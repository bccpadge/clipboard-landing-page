# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## 🧰 Technologies
- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`


## 🌟 Features
- Built-in theme switcher (system, light, dark)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Accessible color contrast 
-  Smooth scroll-to-top button


## 🚧 The Process
During my building process, I wanted to build a custom `<select>` element to allow users to choose between system, light, and dark mode. But I realized that it was a lot of work to implement a custom `<select>` element, so I decided to use the default `<select>` element because it accessible by default and less JavaScript was required.

## ✨ What I learned
- Going back to `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` helped me appreciate the fundamentals without the complexity of frameworks.
- I realized that building a landing page from scratch can be more **enjoyable** and **less overwhelming** than using Astro or other frameworks.
- Practiced **responsive design techniques** with pure `CSS`, re-enforcing my understanding of flexbox and grid.
- Implemented filter `CSS` property to change the Clipboard logo color based on the selected theme.
- Improved my ability to structure clean, semantic `HTML` for accessibility and maintainability.
- Strengthened my confidence in vanilla `JavaScript` for handling simple interactions without relying on libraries.
